# Create a Game-HW 6

We all need to collaborate on creating a game. Post suggestions and/or pictures :)

We are not writing the code and creating an actual game. We are simply developing the idea. What it will look like, who is the main character, what is the objective, etc.


Game Idea #1: Dr. Dog - for ages 8+. A game where children can be veterinarians. Working to diagnose medical problems with different animals, learning about different species, breeds of dogs/cats, and taking steps to heal injured or sick animals.

(Doesn't have to be called Dr. Dog, that's just what I had in my head)
